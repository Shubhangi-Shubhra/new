A client calls a Mule API with an action like success, fail, or something unknown. If the action is success, Mule returns a success message. If the client sends fail, Mule deliberately raises an error and On-Error-Propagate returns a custom failure message. If the client sends any other action, the Choice Router detects it's invalid and returns â€œUnknown action
